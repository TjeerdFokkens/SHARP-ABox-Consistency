# ABox-Consistency
The ABox consistency algorithm, implemented in ACT-R thereby modelling human deductive reasoning.

The Modules contain the production rules of the ACT-R system.
parser.py contains code that takes the ABox and feeds it - in the appropriate form - into the simulation model.
PrepareData is a file that generates the simulations.
